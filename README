# A File Reader in GO!
---
This is a simple yet fast file reader in GO, got a huge load of yap you dont wanna read? Input it into the file reader and boom! You still will have to read the yap, stop being lazy BUT you can read it with the file reader.
In order to use open cmd, CD into src and run go run main.go, simple as that.
